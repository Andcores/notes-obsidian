## **Protecting Valuable  data**
**The security risk management**
This domain emphasized establishing robust security goals, mitigating potential risk, and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory standards
[[Security And Risk Management]]

Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an organization's secure posture include 

 * Security goals and objetives
 * risk mitigation processes 
 * compliance
 * business continuity plans
 * legal regulations
 * professional and organizational ethics 

information security (InfoSec), is also related to this domain and refers to a set processes established to secure information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part o their security and risk management program, based in their needs and perceived risk. there are many infosec design processes, such as:
* incident response
* vulnerability management
* application security
* cloud security
* infrastructure security

As an example, a security team may need to alter how personally identifiable information (PII) is treated in order to adhere to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**The asset Security**
This domain focused on security both digital and physical assets, including proper data storage, maintenance,retention, and secure disposal methods 
[[Asset Security]]

This domain involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance,retention , and destruction of physical and virtual data.



**Identity and access Management (IAM)**
This domain strictly controlling who  can access sensitive data,IAM forms the front line of defense.It ensures only authorized individuals with legitimate reasons can view, modify, or interact with valuable information.

[[Identity and Access Management]]

this identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure. it does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized. this help prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.

Essentially, IAM uses that is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number while working to resolver the customer's issue the remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.




**Security Assessment and testing**

think of this as proactively identifying weak points in your defenses *before* someone can exploit them to access valuable data. By finding and fixing vulnerabilities, you're making that data much harder to steal

[[Security Assessment and Testing]]

this domain focused on identifying and mitigating risk , threats, and vulnerabilities. Security assessment help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as " pen testers", to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor.

This domain suggests that organizations conduct security control testing, as well as collect and analyze data. Additionally, it emphasized the importance of conducting security audits to monitor for and reduce the probability of a data breach. To contribute to these types of tasks, cybersecurity professionals may be tasked with auditing user permissions to validate that users have the correct levels of access to internal systems.



**Security Operations**
in this domain acts as your rapid response team. if someone attempts to breach your defenses and access valuable data, security operations jump in to contain the damage, neutralize the threat, and investigate how to prevent similar incidents in the future.

[[Security Operations]]

this domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred. This includes using strategies,processes, and tools such as:


- Training and awareness
- reporting and documentation 
- intrusion detection and prevention
- SIEM tools
- log management
- incident management
- playbooks
- post-breach forensics 
- reflecting on lessons learned 

The cybersecurity professionals involved in this domain work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats, risk , and vulnerabilities. These individuals are trained to handle active attacks, such as large amount of data being accessed from an organization's internal network, outside of normal working hours. Once a threat os identified, the team works diligently to keep private data and information safe from threat actors.


**Software Development Security**

In this domain ensures that applications and systems that handle valuable data are  are built with security in mind from the ground up.By incorporating secure coding practices and rigorous testing, you're making that data much less susceptible to attacks in the first place .

[[Software Development Security]]

this domain focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create applications. Having secure application helps deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.

Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release. to achieve security, the software development process must have security in mind at each step.Security cannot be an afterthought.

Performing application security tests can help ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated accordingly. Having a system in place to test the programming conventions, software executable , and security measures embedded in the software is necessary. Having quality assurance and pen tester professionals ensure the software has met security and performance standards is also an essential part of the software development process.Â For example, an entry-level analyst working for a pharmaceutical company might be asked to make sure encryption is properly configured for a new medical device that will store private patient data.

## **Building a Secure Framework**


**Security architecture and engineering**
emphasizes designing and implementing effective security tools, systems,and processes. it highlights the importance of shared responsibility in maintaining a secure environment.
[[Security Architecture and Engineering]]

one important aspect of this domain is the concept of share responsibility. Share responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system. additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:
* Threat modeling
* least privilege 
* defense in depth 
* fail securely
* separation of duties 
* keep it simple
* zero trust 
* trust but verify
An example of managing data is the use of a security information and event management (SIEM) tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a threat actor is attempting to access private data.

**Communication and network security**


this domain focuses on safeguarding organizational data and communications across various channels, including on-site, cloud-based, and remote connections. it emphasizes vulnerabilities,such as those associated with insecure Bluetooth or public Wi-Fi usage.
[[Communication and Network Security]]

This domains focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. this include on-site, remote, and cloud communications.

Organizations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organization's networks is a challenge. Designing network security controls- such as restricted networks access-can help protect users and ensure an organization's  network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office
